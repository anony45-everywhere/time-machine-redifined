**Title:** Gravity Anchor-Based Time Machine: A Novel Approach to Time Dilation Without Relativistic Mass Increase

**Author:** Likhith Sai Seemala

**Abstract:**
This paper presents a novel time machine theory based on bypassing relativistic mass increase by using an external gravitational manipulation method. The proposed system utilizes a continuously orbiting object, powered by an infinite energy generator, to manipulate local gravity and create a time dilation field. This innovative approach combines elements of general relativity, electromagnetism, quantum field theory, and energy harvesting to achieve controlled time travel while avoiding traditional energy and mass limitations.

**1. Introduction**

Time travel has long been a subject of theoretical physics, typically constrained by the challenges of energy consumption and relativistic mass increase at high velocities. This paper introduces a new paradigm: instead of accelerating the traveler, an external mass (Gravity Anchor) orbits around the traveler to manipulate spacetime curvature and induce gravitational time dilation.

**2. Core Components**

**2.1 Gravity Anchor System**
- A dense object orbits the traveler at high velocity.
- Uses General Relativity:
    - Time dilation near a massive, moving object.
    - Modeled by the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics.

**2.2 Infinite Energy Generator**
- Self-sustaining energy cycle developed by the author.
- Combines:
    - Mechanical force amplification
    - Electromagnetic induction
    - Resonance effects
    - Magnetic repulsion
    - Vibration energy harvesting
    - Flywheel storage
- Supports continuous acceleration of the Gravity Anchor.

- Inspired by Podkletnov’s rotating superconductors.

**3.2 Rotating Plasma Torus**
- High-speed plasma ring enhances EM fields.
- Analogous to Tokamak systems.
- Supports field curvature and particle manipulation.

**3.3 Resonant EM Field Oscillators**
- Amplify field strength using Earth’s resonance or tuned EM frequencies.
- May simulate mass manipulation (Woodward effect).

**3.4 Quantum Coherence Fields (Optional)**
- Uses entanglement and synchronization to stabilize time dilation.
- Enables cross-reference of temporal data.

**4. Theoretical Foundations**

**4.1 Gravitational Time Dilation**
\[\Delta t = t_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}\]
- Time moves slower near massive objects.
- Enhanced using rotating and accelerating Gravity Anchor.

**4.2 Avoiding Relativistic Mass Increase**
- Traveler remains stationary.
- External mass generates required spacetime curvature.

**4.3 Energy Independence**
- Infinite Energy Generator removes power constraints.

**5. Simulation and Modeling (Planned)**

A Python-based simulation will model:
- Orbital mechanics of the Gravity Anchor
- Time dilation curves
- EM and plasma field interactions
- Feedback control loop for energy regulation
